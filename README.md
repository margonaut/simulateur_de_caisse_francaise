# Simulator de Caisse FranÃ§aise

**(French Checkout Simulator)**

## Description

This command line game was written as an excercise to learn two languages: French, and Rust.

The player's goal is to navigate through a conversation with a French cashier who has little patience for anglos and will switch to English as soon as you make a mistake.

Every prompt from the cashier has a set of simple potential valid responses. Player input is case-insensitive but requires correct accents.

### Controls

```js
// Get hints about how you can respond!
> uhhhhh
> uhhh
> uh

// Give up and quit.
> q
```

### Potential Features

1. Easy mode, where accented characters are ignored.
2. Select different types of cashiers to interact with.
